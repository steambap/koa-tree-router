Koa tree router is a high performance router for Koa.

## Features

- Fast. Up to 11 times faster than Koa-router. [Benchmark](https://github.com/delvedor/router-benchmark)

- Express-style routing using `router.get`, `router.put`, `router.post`, etc.

- Support for `405 method not allowed`

- Multiple middleware per route

## How does it work?

The router relies on a tree structure which makes heavy use of *common prefixes*, it is basically a *compact* [*prefix tree*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (or just [*Radix tree*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)).

This module's tree implementation is based on [julienschmidt/httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i koa-tree-router
# yarn
yarn add koa-tree-router
```

## Usage

```JS
import Koa from "koa";
import Router from "koa-tree-router";

const app = new Koa();
const router = new Router();

router.get("/", (ctx) => {
  ctx.body = "hello, world";
});

app.use(router.routes());

app.listen(8080);
```

## API

#### Router([options])
Instance a new router.  
```js
import Router from "koa-tree-router";

const router = new Router({
  onMethodNotAllowed(ctx) {
    ctx.body = "not allowed";
  },
  ignoreTrailingSlash: true
});
```

#### on(method, path, middleware)
Register a new route.
```js
router.on('GET', '/example', (ctx) => {
  // your code
})
```

#### Shorthand methods
If you want to get expressive, here is what you can do:
```js
router.get(path, middleware)
router.delete(path, middleware)
router.head(path, middleware)
router.patch(path, middleware)
router.post(path, middleware)
router.put(path, middleware)
router.options(path, middleware)
router.trace(path, middleware)
router.connect(path, middleware)
```

If you need a route that supports *all* methods you can use the `all` api.
```js
router.all(path, middleware)
```

#### use(middleware)
You can add middleware that is added to all future routes:
```js
router.use(authMiddleware);
router.get("/foo", (ctx) => { /* your code */ });
router.get("/bar", (ctx) => { /* your code */ });
router.get("/baz", (ctx) => { /* your code */ });
```

This is equivalent to:
```js
router.get("/foo", authMiddleware, (ctx) => { /* your code */ });
router.get("/bar", authMiddleware, (ctx) => { /* your code */ });
router.get("/baz", authMiddleware, (ctx) => { /* your code */ });
```
**Caveat**: `use` must be called before register a new handler. It does not append handlers to registered routes.

#### routes
Returns router middleware.

```JS
app.use(router.routes());
```

#### nested routes
A way to create groups of routes without incuring any per-request overhead.

```js
import Koa from "koa";
import Router from "koa-tree-router";

const app = new Koa();
const router = new Router();
const group = router.newGroup("/foo");
// add a handler for /foo/bar
group.get("/bar", (ctx) => {
  ctx.body = "hello, world";
});

app.use(router.routes());

app.listen(8080);
```

Middleware added with `use()` are also added to the nested routes.

#### ctx.params
This object contains key-value pairs of named route parameters.

```JS
router.get("/user/:name", function() {
  // your code
});
// GET /user/1
ctx.params.name
// => "1"
```

## How to write routes
There are 3 types of routes:

1.Static
```
Pattern: /static

 /static                   match
 /anything-else            no match
```

2.Named

Named parameters have the form `:name` and only match a single path segment:
```
Pattern: /user/:user

 /user/gordon              match
 /user/you                 match
 /user/gordon/profile      no match
 /user/                    no match
```

3.Catch-all

Catch-all parameters have the form `*name` and match everything. They must always be at the **end** of the pattern:

```
Pattern: /src/*filepath

 /src/                     match
 /src/somefile.go          match
 /src/subdir/somefile.go   match
```
